# Local Storage Demo

Recently learnt more about Local Storage and developed this small demo.

The form fields are stored in Local Storage with an onclick keyup listener (inspect local storage in developer tools to see this happen in real-time).

- Refreshing the browser clears the form but preserves local storage
- <strong>Restore</strong> - populates the form again from local storage data (if any)
- <strong>Clear</strong> - removes ALL local storage

### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

Local Storage Demo is just kept simple using pure javscript. [Bootstrap] is used for styling.

### Installation

Clone the repo and start having a play.

```sh
