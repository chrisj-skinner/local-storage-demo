# Local Storage Demo

Form fields are stored in Local Storage. Restore button re-populates form with stored data. Clear button removes ALL local storage.

Form fields are stored in Local Storage with an onclick keyup.

- Inspect local storage in developer tools to see this happen in real-time
- Refreshing the browser clears the form but preserves local storage
- <strong>Restore</strong> - populates the form again from local storage data (if any)
- <strong>Clear</strong> - removes ALL local storage
